# Risk prediction of 30-day mortality after stroke using machine learning techniques: a nationwide registry-based cohort study

## Overview

* This repository provides pre-trained models for future studies to externally validate the trained models in a paper
* Please get in touch if you would like to collaborate on externally validate this post-stroke 30-day mortality prediction model
   + Email: wenjuan.wang@kcl.ac.uk
* If you use code/trained models from this repository, please cite the pre-print as a condition of use

## About the models

The file validation.R validates five models that were initially trained on SSNAP registry data in 2013-2018. The five models are: Logistic Regression (LR) reference model, LR, LR with elastic net, LR with elastic net and interaction terms, and XGBoost.

The script imports a validation dateset (validation.csv) and generates the following:

1. Evaluate discrimination (area under the ROC curve (AUC)) of the pre-trained models on the validation dataset;
2. Evaluate the Brier Score of the pre-trained models on the validation dataset;
3. Evaluate calibration (calibration-in-the-large, calibration slop and calibration plots) on the validation dataset;
4. Generate the decision curve with net benefit at every probability thresthold;
5. Export the above results in a file

Note:
* The code does not perform any training or cross-validation;
* Imputation was done with median/mean values of each variable (default values are from the training set of the original model due to the assumption that the data for validation are not known beforehand);

## How to use this repository

1. Prepare your validation dataset (named validation.csv) according to the below specification.
2. Run validation.R.
3. Email the resulting file to wenjuan.wang@kcl.ac.uk.

### Measures needed to validate these models

#### Outcomes

* The outcome is in-hospital 30-day mortality after stroke
* Each outcome is coded as 1 if the patient died within 30 days in hospital after stroke

In the SSNAP sample (n=358588), the event rate was: 12.4%

#### Important

* All variables/features must be measured within 24 hours after hospital admission
* All variable names and coding have to be exactly the same as the above table


### Software enviornment

* Data cleaning and training were performed in R 3...
* Required packages are 
* For testing purposes, similated data was generated for validation data. These values are randomly generated and are not representative of the training dataset.
* To test all models on the simulated dataset, run:

### Missing data handling

* Missing data in the training set were imputed as the following:
   + New category for ....
   + MICE for NIHSS components and then NIHSS arrival was imputed by adding the NIHSS components
* Missing data in the validation set will use mean/median of the validation set (many cases) or default values from training set.
